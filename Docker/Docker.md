## Lab 1 - Docker

##### 1. What is Docker, and how does it differ from traditional virtualization?
Docker is an open-source containerization platform where developers can develop, test, ship and run their programs without worrying about developer's infrastructure. The use of containers makes it easier to run on any IT infrastructure.

###### Docker v/s Traditional virtualization

Virtual machines have the 'Host OS' and 'Guest OS' in their architecture where the virtual machines acts like a physical computer on a host computer. For each Virtual machines, guest OS is needed to be booted up. Therefore, it virtulizes the system kernal and application layer. On the other hand, Docker only virtualizes the application layer by sharing the Host OS between the containers. It makes it light and faster to boot than virtual machines as it does not need the boot Guest OS to run the application.

##### 2. What is the purpose of a Dockerfile in the image-building process?
##### 3. What does the FROM instruction in the Dockerfile do, and why is it important?
##### 4. Explain the purpose of the COPY instruction in the Dockerfile.
##### 5. What does the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile define, and why is it important?
